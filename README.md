Blog
====

The Blog module allows registered users to maintain an online journal, or *blog*. Blogs are made up of individual *blog entries*. By default, the blog entries are displayed by creation time in descending order, with comments enabled, and are promoted to the site's front page.

Installation
------------

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at <https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules>.

Uses
----

**Single-user blogs**
Each user's blog entries are automatically displayed with a link to the user's main blog page. You can create as many single-user blogs as you have site users with permission to create blog content.

**Multi-user blogs**
Blog entries from each single-user blog are also aggregated into one central multi-user blog, which displays the blog content of all users in a single listing.

**Navigation**
There is an optional *Blogs* menu item added to the Navigation menu, which displays all blogs available on your site, and a *My blog* item displaying the current user's blog entries.

**Blocks**
The Blog module also creates a default *Recent blog posts* block that may be enabled at the blocks administration page (admin/structure/block).
